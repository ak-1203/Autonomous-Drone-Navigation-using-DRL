# 🛰️ Autonomous Drone Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## 📌 Note

> 🛠️ **This is an ongoing project.**  
> Future improvements include trajectory planning, multi-axis stabilization, generalization to arbitrary start and target points, and possibly integration with a real drone platform.

This is an ongoing project focused on developing an autonomous drone system capable of navigating from an arbitrary start coordinate **A** to a target coordinate **B** using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. The current stage focuses on achieving **stable hovering and altitude control**, which has been successfully implemented.
